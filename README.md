## Git Commit Message Convention for Team 🤜🏻🤛🏻
A Git commit message convention is a set of guidelines for writing commit messages that are clear, concise, and informative. These guidelines help to ensure that commit messages are consistent, easy to understand, and provide important information about the changes made in a commit. Developers can more easily collaborate on projects, track changes, and understand the history of a project.

### A standard git commit message typically appears as follows:
```bash
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

### The “type” field must be chosen from the options listed below:
- build : Changes related to building the code (e.g. adding npm dependencies or external libraries).
- chore: Changes that do not affect the external user (e.g. updating the .gitignore file or .prettierrc file).
- feat: A new feature.
- fix: A bug fix.
- docs: Documentation a related changes.
- refactor: A code that neither fix bug nor adds a feature. (eg: You can use this when there is semantic changes like renaming a variable/ function name).
- perf: A code that improves performance style: A code that is related to styling.
- test: Adding new test or making changes to existing test

### The “scope” is optional
The “scope” field should be a noun that represents the part of the codebase affected by the commit.

For example, if the commit changes the login page, the scope could be “login”. If the commit affects multiple areas of the codebase, “global” or “all” could be used as the scope.

Refer this [link](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/dev/git-commit-msg.html) for example related to scope.

### Write understandable “Subject”
“The “subject” field should be a brief description of the commit, written in the imperative present tense. It should not end with a period and the first letter should not be capitalized.

For example, “add login page” or “fix bug in search functionality” are both appropriate subjects.”
